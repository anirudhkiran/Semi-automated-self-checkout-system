# Semi-automated-self-checkout-system

This project was carried out by a two-member team. The application was developed using Java, JDBC, Java Server Pages, HTML5, CSS3 and MySQL. It provides a mechanism for customers to process their own purchases from a retailer. It is an alternative to the traditional cashier-staffed checkout. Essentially, it is a queue management system that can be used in large scale commercial complexes. The customer performs the job of a cashier themselves. The application generates a token and a payment is made against each token by the customer. The payment receipt is shown to the retailer. Upon confirming the payment, the retailer gives the product to the customer. A token is used to keep track of each transaction.
